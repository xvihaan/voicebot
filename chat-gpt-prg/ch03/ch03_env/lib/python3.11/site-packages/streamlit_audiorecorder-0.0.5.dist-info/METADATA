### An audio Recorder for streamlit

#### Description
Audio recorder component for streamlit.  
It creates a button to start the recording and takes three arguments: the start button text, the stop button text, and the pause button text.  
If the pause button text is not specified, the pause button is not displayed.

![Example with buttons](images/buttons.gif)

If all prompts are given as empty strings, the component will use the [react-audio-recorder](https://github.com/samhirtarif/react-audio-recorder) visualizer:

#### Parameters
The signature of the component is:
```python
audiorecorder(start_prompt="Start recording", stop_prompt="Stop recording", pause_prompt="", show_visualizer=True, key=None):
```
The prompt parameters are self-explanatory.  
The optional `key` parameter is used internally by Streamlit to properly distinguish multiple audiorecorders on the page.  
The `show_visualizer` parameter is a boolean that determines whether to show live audio visualization while recording. If set to False, the text "recording" is displayed. It is used only when all prompts are empty strings.

#### Return value
The component's return value is a [pydub](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub/) [`AudioSegment`](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub/blob/master/API.markdown#audiosegment).  
All `AudioSegment` methods are available. In particular, you can:
- Play the audio in the frontend with `st.audio(audio.export().read())`
- Save the audio to a file with `audio.export("audio.wav", format="wav")`

### Installation:
```bash
pip install streamlit-audiorecorder
```
Note: This package uses ffmpeg, so it should be installed for this audiorecorder to work properly.

On Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg`  
On Mac: `brew install ffmpeg`

### Usage:
```python
import streamlit as st
from audiorecorder import audiorecorder

st.title("Audio Recorder")
audio = audiorecorder("Click to record", "Click to stop recording")

if len(audio) > 0:
    # To play audio in frontend:
    st.audio(audio.export().read())  

    # To save audio to a file, use pydub export method:
    audio.export("audio.wav", format="wav")

    # To get audio properties, use pydub AudioSegment properties:
    st.write(f"Frame rate: {audio.frame_rate}, Frame width: {audio.frame_width}, Duration: {audio.duration_seconds} seconds")
```

### Troubleshooting:

**Error**: No record button is shown and you get the following error message in the console:
 ```console
 Component Error
 Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'getUserMedia')
 ```
**Reason**: To record the audio, this component uses the `MediaDevices`` interface.  
For security reasons, the `getUserMedia()` method is available only in secure contexts (HTTPS), as explained in the
[MDM documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia) :

> As an API that may involve significant privacy concerns, getUserMedia()'s specification lays out a wide array of privacy and security requirements that browsers are obligated to meet.
> 
> getUserMedia() is a powerful feature that can only be used in secure contexts; in insecure contexts, navigator.mediaDevices is undefined, preventing access to getUserMedia(). A secure context is, in short, a page loaded using HTTPS or the file:/// URL scheme, or a page loaded from localhost.

**Solution**: Serve your website using HTTPS. If you are serving your website locally, make sure to access it using `localhost`, not an IP address.
